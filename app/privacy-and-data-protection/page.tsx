                    I am committed to protecting your privacy and this policy outlines what information I will collect from you and how I use it. I am registered under the provisions of the Data Protection Act 1998 (“the Act“).
                </li>
                <li>
                    The provisions of the Act impose a legal duty on me to protect any Personal Data (as defined by the Act), which you provide.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I ask you for personal information to enable me to carry out your transaction and I ask you to give me only the information which is essential to carry out your instructions to me. I use the information to contact you by letter (post or facsimile), email or telephone to keep you informed as to the progress of your file and to answer any queries you may have. I keep records as required by the Solicitors’ Regulation Authority and others and I maintain a contacts list. You may ask to be removed from this list at any time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I do not sell your information to any third party and I do not intend to do so in the future. I use the information collected about you for purposes of checking your identity on paper documents and on-line with Formations Direct. I may also ask you to provide proof of address and evidence of funds for this particular transaction, to meet the requirements of any mortgage lender, the seller or buyer, mortgage lender and their representative as appropriate, or the anti money laundering authorities. See further details on this in my standard terms letter.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I may use your e-mail address to notify you of other services which I provide from time to time. You may ask me to remove your e-mail address from my listing at any time. If you email information to me I may at my discretion forward this to a relevant third party. See the terms on which I correspond by e-mail at the foot of my e-mails to you.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Personal Data will be used strictly for the purposes of your current transaction, unless you have given your authority to disclose the data, or I am obliged to disclose it by reason of statutory requirements, court order or anti-money laundering regulations.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Please also refer to the paragraph concerning storage of documents in my standard terms letter.
                </li>

                    You may set your internet browser to refuse cookies or you can ask your internet browser to alert you when a cookie is being set up if any data is sent to your computer in this form. I am not aware of any such cookies which would be sent from my website but these may be incorporated into the website in the future.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You have the right to request me to provide a copy of the personal data held in your records. I will charge a data request fee of £10 for each request made and I will provide the information within 40 days of receipt of your payment of the said fee.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Please direct any concerns regarding your privacy to me personally. If you are not satisfied with the outcome you may complain to the Legal Ombudsman (details as previously given) or to the Data Protection Agency.
